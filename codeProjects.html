            <p>Here is all of my programming and design work, showcasing my technical skills and focus on user
                 experience. I developed games using C++ and SFML in my first year of IDAD and another game in
                  JavaScript during my second year. Iâ€™ve also worked on websites both inside and outside SETU,
                   using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Throughout these projects, I combined coding with UX
                 research and UI design to create user-friendly, accessible interfaces that enhance usability.</p>

                            I made changes where need while increasing the fidelity. I add a spotify preview along with link to their relevent socials and a place to book tickets for their upcoming gig.</p>

                            This is a meduim fidelity website redesign I designed for UI testing in 2nd year. I was tasked with redesigning a website with a 
                            bad or outdate design. USAP is a us website about Antartica, it has loads of information and programs but I found that it looked very outdated compared to other 
                            US gov websites so I tried to give it  modern refresh

                            This is a website I made for D&N O'Reilly Solidfuels & Timber, a local company here in carlow That sells solid fuels and gas.
                            I made this website with the help of shopify I used presets and then add my html and css on top to get right look. Most of my
                            was spent making layouts and choosing colour schemes.

                            <p>The project began with extensive market research, focusing on fuel websites in Ireland. Initially, I examined major brands like 
                                Top Oil to gather insights. After presenting my findings to my employer, I inquired whether he wanted a similar website style.
                                 While he appreciated certain aspects,
                                 he expressed a desire to avoid a corporate, soulless look. This feedback 
                                 prompted me to pivot my research towards smaller, local family businesses, such as Kennyâ€™s Fuels.
                                <br><br>
                                Through this exploration, I identified elements that instill trust and convey care in a family-run business. I discovered the 
                                importance of showcasing the people behind the business and using language that resonates with the local community. After compiling
                                 new images and text that captured this essence, my employer was excited, and we began brainstorming ideas for displaying employees
                                  and determining the necessary visuals.</p>

                              <p>TThe initial phase of the project revealed that DNoreilly Fuels lacked a logo,
                                 so I prioritized its creation. Developing a cohesive
                                  design and color scheme would establish a foundation for the rest of the website. Crafting a 
                                  logo that embodied the brandâ€™s personality was challenging, especially as I was not highly experienced
                                   in logo design. Nevertheless, I pushed forward with my concepts and began wireframing to determine the best layout.
                                <br><br>
                                Selecting the color scheme was also difficult. Initially, my employer favored red and blue,
                                 similar to Kennyâ€™s Fuels and the trucks he owned. While the red was certainly eye-catching,
                                  it felt too serious and did not align with the desired brand image. We needed a more 
                                  friendly and approachable palette. During this process, my employer noticed a sweet wrapper
                                   with a green and yellow color scheme. Though I was initially skeptical, it ultimately
                                    proved to be a perfect fit, lending the website a welcoming aesthetic.
                                <br><br>
                                In terms of typography, I experimented with various typeface combinations to achieve a modern
                                 and friendly look. 
                                 <br><br>
                                Further into development my employer decide to get a logo done by a professonal  logo designer, this helped me really center the design and look of the whole brand.</p>

                                   prompted me to pivot my research towards smaller, local family businesses, such as Kennyâ€™s Fuels.

                        <p>
                            This is a website I built in IDAD year 2 in the first semester. This was my first time using javascript extensivly.
                             Our theme was Time so I decide to make a game where you have to solve a puzzle using time portals to your advatage.
                             There is one portal that take you to the future and one to the past, in the past there is more enemy as the building is not abandoned yet
                             but in the past is also where all the tech still works well. Using these portals you must find a way to escape I didn't 
                             have enough time to add an ending so once you beat it it just goes on to the next leveland repeats.
                             <br>
                             <br>
                            I used a js canvas to render the sprites, the game is both desktop and mobile compatiable and can be downloaded as a PWA it also saves 
                            user data in local storage so you play from where you left off. I also used a song I composed in FL and add walking and running sound effects I found online.

                        <h3>SETU Carlow</h3>
                        <p>
                            Cardochism was the end of year group project for IDAD in first year. The game is a bullet hell and involves the player dodging and 
                            killing enemies and once the time runs out the player has the chance to buy from the shop to get more lives or attack cards. The main game mechanic is 
                            is the ability to speed up and slow down the games playing at faster speeds means better reward but can be to difficult all the Time
                            so you can also slow time to dodge easier.<br><br>
                            I mainly worked on art I made all the backgrounds the player animations and the bullets all using photoshop. I also worked on some of the code I added 
                            the bullet shooting functions and the some of the animations using C++. I also added the main game music which 
                            I made using Fl studio.

                            My end of year project for first year Cat and Rat, this games is about shooting rats and mice before they get to the cheese.
                            All of the art assets were made in aseprite and I coded the game in cpp using sfml library.  
                            <br><br>
                            The enemies descend from the top of the screen while moving randomly left and right then when they are closes to the cheese they head in a direct line 
                            towards it. The player can shoot bouncing bullets to try to stop the enemy one hit will kill the mice but two will be need for the rats. Outside of college I added
                            a milk power up the gives the player more speed.<br><br>

                            Heli-Shooter is the first game I made in 1st year The aim of the game is to shoot targets that spawn randomly on the screen
                            when the player hits one they get points and a new target spwans. The shooting is very buggy as it is the first game I made but it does 
                            function and is playable.<br><br>
                            The assests were made in aseprite accept for the gameplay background which I got online. I coded the game in cpp using sfml library.

                            This is a game I made in my spare time over the summer, the aim of the game is to collect food and gorw as big as possible.
                            yellow pellets spawn randomly around to screen eating them increase player size once the player is big enough they can 
                            choose to evolve with the number keys.
                            I only did coding for this porject again I used c++ with sfml libs <br><br>
